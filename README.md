# Java Chat Application

## Overview
This educational project is a Java-based chat system between multiple clients. The server manages user connections, handles logins, and ensures message delivery.

## Client-Server Communication
- **Protocol(own):** TCP/IP for reliable communication.
- **Technology:** Java sockets for connection management.

## Testcases
The project is supported by JUnit tests. They can be found in the usual test directory.

## Protocol Overview
The protocol describes the following scenarios:

- Establishing a connection between client and server.
- Broadcasting messages to all connected clients.
- Sending heartbeat messages to check client activity.
- Handling client disconnection.
- Managing invalid messages.
- Displaying a list of all connected users.
- Sending private and broadcast messages.
- Creating and sending surveys.
- Sending files.
- Sending encrypted messages. (RSA and AES)

**Note:** Most messages between the server and clients that include usernames must be separated by a `:` character.
